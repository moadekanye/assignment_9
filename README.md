# question 1
Different types of exercise make your heart beat at different speeds. More active exercises, like running, make your heart beat faster, while calmer exercises, like stretching, keep it slower. Eating certain foods can also affect your heart rate during exercise, as some foods give you more energy. This shows that both moving your body and eating well help keep your heart healthy.
# question 2
The orbital period vs. distance relational plot shows the relationship between a planet's distance from its star and the time it takes to orbit. By color-coding the discovery methods, it reveals that certain techniques are more effective at finding planets at specific distances. A count plot of discovery methods is also useful, showing the popularity and effectiveness of different methods in astronomy. Together, these plots illustrate trends in planetary discoveries and highlight how various techniques excel at detecting planets with specific characteristics.

This project analyzes the effects of diet and exercise on heart rate, using data collected from a local gym in partnership with an elementary school. The project includes a DataProcessor class for loading, cleaning, and preparing the data, and a Visualizer class for generating heatmaps and categorical plots. The data is stored in a CSV file, and the visualizations aim to provide insights that can be shared with elementary school students to demonstrate how exercise and diet influence heart rate. Key limitations include, basic handling of missing values, and a focus on simple visualizations without real-time data integration or advanced statistical methods.
